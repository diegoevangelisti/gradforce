## GradForce - Talented Students, managed by Us, Working for You

In this app, graduated students from the IT sector, and future employers, have the possibility to upload their profiles: personal information, educational records, work history (for students) and companyâ€™s data and roles information for employers. It looks like, but it is not LinkedIn!
In addition, the administrator can manage all that information in a customized Admin Panel with the following features: 
- Get notified when students completed their profiles.
- Send an email with a link to a calendar invite include. 
- Perform CRUD operations (Create/Read/Update/Delete).
- Redact and send customized emails
- and more.

Give it a try and enjoy! This is the link: http://gradforcenz.herokuapp.com/
or follow the instuctions below if you want to play around

## Setting up the server, database and admin panel to run the app locally
